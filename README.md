# Genetic-Algorithms (Project work for the course CT-17001)

Genetic Algorithms are a class of heuristics for solving optimization and search based problems based on Darwin's theory of natural selection. The crux of the algorithm is "Fittest survive" and use this as the central idea in problem solving. The algorithms employ a series of steps like mutation, selection and crossover which eventually runs until there is convergence of the population.

## Biological overview of Genetic Algorithms

The idea behind Natural Selection is summarized collectively as follows:
* An initial population of species is given.
* The individuals that survive from this population are said to have superior genes.
* These are passed onto the next generation resulting in more mutations due to crossovers.
* The individuals with superior genes are selected for the next generation.
* The end result is a set of individuals that have superior genes which evolved over time.
